            I grew up in Portland, Oregon. Fall in the Pacific NorthWest can't be beat 
            except maybe by the spring in bloom. All the pretty colors in either season! I have always loved animals. 
            Dogs, Cats, Reptiles and more. Learning more about animals was and is a passion of mine. 
            Steve Irwin's zeal was always infectious! I have also drawn all my life. Passionate expression is importnant to me.
            I like to capture the character, and energy of things. Having this beautiful region as my home stretching from MT.Hood or as i like to say "My Mountain" 
            to the shining or often tempestuous Oregon Coast had been endless inspiration to my growth as an artist. Why don't you join me for a little adventure into
            my imagination? There are endless colors to play with!
