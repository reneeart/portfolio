            I'm Renee and I make animal art in a variety of mediums and styles! I grew up in Portland, Oregon and have always been inspired by the world around me. 
            All my life I have been drawing and painting, taking my endless fascination for animals of all types and turning that passion into art. 
            As a child Steve Irwin's zeal for all creatures was always infectious and you could often find me glued to his show with art supplies in hand trying my best to recreate the animals I saw.
            No animal is off the table when I'm at work with my art; whether furry or scaley, enormous or tiny, dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, bats, whales, or bugs you can bet I've tried my hand at drawing or painting as many of them as I can! 
          <p>
            Having this beautiful region as my home, stretching from Mt.Hood (or as I like to say "My Mountain") 
            to the shining and often tempestuous Oregon Coast has been endless inspiration to my growth as an artist. 
            Fall in the Pacific Northwest just can't be beat except maybe by the spring in bloom.  
            All the pretty colors in each season and all of the magnificent wildlife just beyond the backyard are always calling to be painted!
          </p>

            Passionate expression is important to me. 
            I like to capture the character and energy of things, and inject a bit of my own personal style to make something unique.
            Why don't you join me for a little adventure into my imagination? Grab your art supplies, there are endless colors to play with!
